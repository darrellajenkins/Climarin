# About

Climarin, like its corresponding Python code, appeared at a whim.  The name describes a world of fantasy and at the same time refers to the currency of this 
once forgotten realm.  It's designed for two players and is similar to a roguelike game.
Players choose one of four classes:  Warrior, Monster, Sorcerer, or Sage. 

## Code

Written in Python as a part of a daily exercise to practice using class objects and to remember that coding should always be fun.

## How to Run the Program

For now it works best as an emulated run in your Python console. Eventually I will reformat the code to make use of the Python turtle module, and then later 
make use of Pygame.
